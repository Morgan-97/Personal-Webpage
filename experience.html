    <h2>Work: </h2>
    <h3>2017 – 2020 Student Ambassador – Aberystwyth University</h3>
    <p>Helped during open / visit days by welcoming visitors, answering their questions and directing them to each
      event.
      Throughout these days I constantly interacted with all visitors and other staff.
      Also, I am involved in a “student panel” in which we answer common questions for all visitors during a scheduled
      talk.</p>

    <h3>2017 – 2020 Demonstrator – Aberystwyth University</h3>
    <p>This is more of a teaching assistant role, in which I helped during practical sessions by assisting with any
      issues,
      explaining class material in depth and checking that work is properly and correctly completed.</p>

    <h2>Volunteer: </h2>
    <h3>2017 – 2019 Peer Mentor – Aberystwyth University</h3>
    <p>As a peer mentor, I was given mentees who were first / foundation year students who were able to contact me if
      they had any questions.
      I would also contact them via email to check that they are okay and adjusting to student life well at the
      university,
      here may also be meetings with them to discuss any issues or just to have a chat. </p>

    <h3>2017 – 2020 Aber A–Team – Aberystwyth University</h3>
    <p>This volunteering role varied depending on the time of the year. During welcome week,
      I would help students move into their respective accommodation which helps alleviate the stress of moving in as
      there is plenty of help from us.
      Throughout the year I also help during events that the student’s union have organised, mainly sporting events.</p>
